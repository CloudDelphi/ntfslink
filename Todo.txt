- Vista/Win7 support before new release:
     * Support new link types (symbolic)
     * Skip the delete hook, Explorer is now smart enough itself to
       not delete link contents.
     * Windows 7 has it's own link icons, update ours to match, and 
       do not override the builtin icons. The hardlink icon I want
       to replace with something that indicates a bidirectional link,
       for example an error that goes from left to right.
     * The Junction Tracker seems to be writing to HKLM - can we still
       do that?

- Fix GnuGetText/Localization on 64bit. Right now, the unit does not
  work (crashes the 64bit DLL). See the X64DISABLE ifdefs in the code.
  Me might want to have a look at Jvcl's JvGnuGetText version, which
  currently also does not support 64bit.
  
- Simplify: Should we call, for example, the hardlink action "duplicate"?

- Get rid of GUI config utility, keep things simple. Most people don't
  need to change the things offered there, and if they really do, they 
  can always use the registry.
  Especially the option to chose custom overlays really looks like 
  overkill in retrospect.

- Add "Yes to all", "No to all" options in our intercepted dialogs 
  (Mike Ratzlaff, E-Mail).

- Copying a structure that contains links will yield a dialog asking
  the user whether he wants to copy the links (or the contents). If the
  former option is chosen, the created links will be named using the
  "Copy of" prefix, since it's the same piece of code that creates 
  links under normal circumstances (Mike Ratzlaff, E-Mail).

  system (w/ post SP4 update roll-up and KB950582 hotfix) and noticed 
  that icon overlays were enabled by default, but no icon overlays 
  were selected.  I found the overlays in ntfslink.dll and got 
  everything working, but thought you might want to know about this 
  in case it's something that needs to be fixed with the default 
  configuration or installation process.
