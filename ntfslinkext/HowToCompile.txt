How To Compile NTFS Link Ext
****************************

We are currently using Delphi 6 (incl. Runtime Library Update 3) to compile
"NTFS Link Ext". As a registered user, you may get the required updates from
Borland here:

  http://www.borland.com/devsupport/delphi/downloads/ds_registeredusers.html

For building the shell extension, the following components are required:

- Jedi Code Library (JCL), http://jcl.sf.net/
  Download the "Source pack" version 1.95 build 1848 (as of writing, this is the
  most recent version that properly works for us), unpack the archive and follow
  the instructions in "Install.txt" to register the components with Delphi. No
  changes are necessary in the installer, just accept all defaults.

For building the configuration utility, the following components are required:

- Jedi Visual Component Library (JVCL), http://jvcl.sf.net/
  Download the "CompleteNoJCL" version 3.00, which is the most recent version
  that properly works for us with the above version of JCL. Again, unpack the
  archive and follow the instructions in "Install.txt" to register the
  components with Delphi. No changes are necessary in the installer, just accept
  all defaults.

After installing the components either load the project group from the "source"
directory into the IDE, or load the projects separately from the respective
sub-directories. They should compile fine by hitting Ctrl-F9.

Have fun!
