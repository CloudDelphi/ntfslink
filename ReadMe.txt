How To Compile

In addition, some third party libraries are required:

For building the shell extension:

- Jedi Code Library (JCL), http://jcl.sf.net/, Version 2.3 Build 4197 is used.

For building the configuration utility:

- Jedi Visual Component Library (JVCL), http://jvcl.sf.net/, Version 3.45 is used.
