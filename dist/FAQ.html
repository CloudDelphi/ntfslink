    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold">After the installation, is it really necessary that I restart?</span><br />
      No. Logging off should be enough, however, this is currently not supported by the setup tool I use.

      <span style="font-weight: bold">What's the difference between a Hard Link and a Junction Point? I don't get this ...</span><br />
      A really good introduction to Hard Links and Junction Points, which explains everything from the very beginning, was published
      on <a href="http://shell-shocked.org/article.php?id=284">Shell-Shocked</a>.

      <span style="font-weight: bold">So, how can I create links using the Windows Explorer?</span><br />
      NTFS Link Ext currently offers a couple of possibilities to create links:
      <ul>
        <li>The one mostly used is hidden in the Drag &amp; Drop menu.
            Just drag a file using the <em>right</em> mouse button, and drop it somewhere else. A menu will pop up, into
            which NTFS Link Ext has integrated.</li>
        <li>You can use the Explorer-New-Menu. Right-click on an empty place somewhere in any explorer window or
            on the Desktop, and choose <em>New</em>. In its sub-menu, there are two items, titled <em>"NTFS Hard Link"</em>
            and <em>"NTFS Junction Point"</em>.</li>
        <li>A third features allows you to convert an <em>empty</em> (!) folder into a Junction Point. Just right-click on it,
            and choose <em>"NTFS Link Ext | Link Folder"</em> from the menu.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Do I have to expect any issues when deleting links?</span><br />
      For Hard Links definitely not. However, Windows Explorer has no idea how to handle Junction Points. Normally,
      if you would delete a Junction Point, all the content of the target folder would be deleted as well. To fix this,
      NTFS Link Ext intercepts the deletion of folders, and makes sure that Junction Points are correctly processed.<br />
      If you want to make absolutely sure that nothing can happen to your data, right-click on the Junction Point
      and choose <em>"NTFS Link Ext | Unlink Folder"</em>, before deleting it.
    </p>

    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold">What does this "Junction Point tracking" thing in the configuration utility mean?</span><br />
      If you delete, move or rename the target folder of a Junction Point, the Junction Point will stop working. As there is no build-in
      functionality in Windows to find the Junction Points pointing to a folder, NTFS Link Ext tries to keep track of that itself (if
      you create a Junction Point using some other, external utility, NTFS Link Ext will of course not know about it).<br />
      There are two different how this information can be stored: The best solution is "NTFS streams". Basically,
      what it does is attaching additional data to the directories you create links to. No, the problem here is, that streams
      are not supported on FAT drives. To work around that issue, NTFS Link Ext can alternatively use the Registry to save
      the tracking data.
