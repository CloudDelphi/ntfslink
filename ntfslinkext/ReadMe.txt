Read Me for NTFS Link Ext
*************************

NTFS Link Ext is a Drag & Drop shell extension for Windows Explorer. It provides
means for creating so called "Hardlinks" and "Junctions" on NTFS file systems,
as Windows does not come with such tools by itself.

The code is based on the discontinued "NTFS Link", which is (c)2004 by Michael
Elsdoerfer and still available on Novell Forge:

  http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/project/?ntfslink

Please use the above page only for reference. All future development will take
place at the new home for NTFS Link Ext at SourceForge:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/ntfslinkext/

Have fun!
