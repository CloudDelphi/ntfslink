  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Change Log</h1>

    <h2>New in Version 2.1 - 2004-09-02</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>New configuration option to disable the "Link To" prefix in newly created links.</li>
      <li>Icon overlays are now disabled for remote- and floppy drives (speed issues) - thanks to Luke Hamburg and Jan Peter Stotz.</li>
      <li>Version Information included in NTFSLinkExt.dll.</li>
      <li>"Open Target Folder" in a Junction Point's context menu now supports <em>\Volume{GUID}</em>-style links (thanks to Max Kanzler).</li>
      <li>Comes with FAQ.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>New in Version 2.0 - 2004-08-13</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Internationalization: The GUI of NTFS Link Ext is now fully localizable.</li>
      <li>
        Drag &amp; Drop menu item now differing clearly between <em>Junction Points</em> and
        <em>Hard Links</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drag &amp; Drop menu item hidden, if link creation clearly is not possible (e.g. Hard Links
        across different file systems).
      </li>
      <li>Alternative way to create links, through the Shell "<em>New</em>" menu.</li>
      <li>Integration in Context Menu of empty directories and Junction Points.</li>
      <li>Icon Overlays for Junction Points and Hard Links.</li>
      <li>Junction Points can now be safely deleted from within Windows Explorer.</li>
      <li>
        Moving a Junction Point from within Windows Explorer will now only move the Junction Point itself,
        not the contents of the linked directory.
      </li>
      <li>
        When a Junction Point is copied from within Windows Explorer, NTFS Link Ext will ask the user whether
        he wants to copy the Junction Point itself or the contents of the linked directory.
      </li>
      <li>
        When a folder is deleted, to which Junction Points are pointing, a warning dialog will be shown.
      </li>
      <li>Added a bunch of glyphs to all the menu items.</li>
      <li>New Configuration-Utility.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Version 1.0 - 2004-04-05</h2>

    </ul>
