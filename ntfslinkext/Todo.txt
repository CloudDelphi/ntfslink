- Get rid of GUI config utility, keep things simple. Most people don't
  need to change the things offered there, and if they really do, they 
  can always use the registry.

  overkill in retrospect.

- Add "Yes to all", "No to all" options in our intercepted dialogs 
  (Mike Ratzlaff, E-Mail).

- Copying a structure that contains links will yield a dialog asking
  the user whether he wants to copy the links (or the contents). If the
  former option is chosen, the created links will be named using the
  "Copy of" prefix, since it's the same piece of code that creates 
  links under normal circumstances (Mike Ratzlaff, E-Mail).
